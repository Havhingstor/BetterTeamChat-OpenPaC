# BetterTeamChat

This minecraft/fabric mod allows the user to automatically send their messages to their team or a specific player, without the need to use the default commands.

## How to use:

Set the current target for plain text chat messages with `/stdChatGlobal`, `/stdChatTeam` or `/stdChatPlayer <Player>`, the current state can be queried with `/stdChat`.
  
If the current state isn't global, but one specific message should be sent in the global chat, `/globalmsg <global message>` should be used.
