# BetterTeamChat-OpenPaC

This mod is a add-on for the mod "BetterTeamChat" (https://github.com/Havhingstor/BetterTeamChat), which allows the `stdChatTeam`-command to also target OpenPaC-parties.

This allows the player to reroute his messages directly to the party-chat of OpenPaC, so he doesn't have to use the /opm-command.

This mod is not associated with OpenPaC, which can be found at https://github.com/thexaero/open-parties-and-claims.
